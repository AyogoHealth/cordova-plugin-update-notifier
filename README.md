cordova-plugin-update-notifier
==============================

This plugin provides a mechanism for showing an in-app notification when a new
version of the app is available for download from the App Store or Play Store.

For iOS, this uses the [Siren][siren] library.

For Android, this implements the [Play Store In-App Update][playlib] system.


Installation
------------

### Cordova

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-update-notifier
```

### Capacitor

```
npm install cordova-plugin-update-notifier
npx cap sync
```

#### Note about Android strings for Capacitor

To override the text shown in the banner when an update is ready to install,
add the following to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`:

```xml
<string name="app_update_ready">An update has just been downloaded.</string>
<string name="app_update_install">RESTART</string>
```

Configuration Preferences
------------

### Alert Type

Siren's implementation for iOS allows for different alert types (see https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren#screenshots). You can set the value to "critical" or "annoying" in config.xml.

```xml
<preference name="SirenAlertType" value="critical" />
<preference name="SirenAlertType" value="annoying" />
```

For Android, you can force all updates to be considered "immediate" with the `AndroidUpdateAlertType` preference in config.xml.

```xml
<preference name="AndroidUpdateAlertType" value="Immediate" />
```

### Non US-AppStore iOS apps

Siren's implementation for iOS requires specifying a country code if your app is not published to the US AppStore.

```xml
<preference name="SirenCountryCode" value="CA" />
```

For Capacitor, add `"SirenCountryCode": "CA"` to your capacitor.config.json file.


### Managed App Configuration

When deploying an app using an MDM, you can take advantage of [Managed App Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/sc2279/Introduction/Intro.html) to disable the update check. Simply create a preference called "DisableUpdateCheck" and set it's value to "true".
